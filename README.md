5 March 2020: Two new modes added:

-While left button is pressed, you can change the speed of the main timer up to x15 faster tweaking POT 1

-Also, while left button is pressed, you can tweak POT 2 to change the main sample rate, going for the actual 16384Hz down to 256Hz, 
so now you can tune the machine to your preferred interval down to LFOs speeds.

Glitch Storm is an exploratory synth that can be build and soldered even for total beginners. It produces a plethora of blips and blops ranging for chords, techno rhythms to alien soundscapes and FXs.

At its core is a Bytebeat synth but this one is interactive. You play it tuning into frequencies and soundscapes. You have four dimensions in it to explore, three ones via the knobs and a forth one via buttons, changing the equation that is playing.

The unit is able to be played as a standalone or in the context of one studio or modular.

Is quite good for pinging filters too and can enter in an easteregg mode for it to trigger gate outs for synchronizing external gear with it.
